# ML_Data_Management

## Overview
The project's purpose is to showcase a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data generation to model evaluation. It serves as a demonstration of various essential steps in the process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and tuning.

Main Features and Functionalities:

Synthetic data generation for user activity and responses.
Comprehensive data preprocessing, handling missing values, and capping outliers.
Feature engineering, introducing new meaningful features for improved model performance.
Training a RandomForestClassifier for user rating prediction.
Model evaluation using various metrics to assess performance.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to enhance model accuracy.
Visualizations to provide insights into dataset characteristics.
Documentation and reporting for clear understanding and reproducibility.
This project serves as both an educational resource for understanding machine learning workflows and as a starting point for users looking to build and extend their own machine learning projects.

Data Generation: Synthetically generates user activity and response data, including features such as 'UserID', 'CourseViews', 'TimeSpent', 'QuizScores', 'Ratings', and 'Feedback'.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, caps outliers, and creates a new feature ('NewFeature') as the product of 'TimeSpent' and 'QuizScores'.

Feature Engineering (Future Engineering): Introduces a new feature ('FeedbackLength') based on the length of the 'Feedback' text.
Scales numerical features using StandardScaler.

Model Training: Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier to predict user 'Ratings'.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets and calculates accuracy as a performance metric.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error.

Model Tuning: Uses GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.

Results Visualization: Provides visualizations, including pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots, to offer insights into the relationships within the dataset.

Documentation and Reporting: Encourages good coding practices with modular functions and documentation. Guides users on dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
