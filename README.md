Data Generation:

Synthetically generates user activity and response data, including features such as 'UserID', 'CourseViews', 'TimeSpent', 'QuizScores', 'Ratings', and 'Feedback'.
Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values, caps outliers, and creates a new feature ('NewFeature') as the product of 'TimeSpent' and 'QuizScores'.
Feature Engineering (Future Engineering):

Introduces a new feature ('FeedbackLength') based on the length of the 'Feedback' text.
Scales numerical features using StandardScaler.
Model Training:

Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier to predict user 'Ratings'.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets and calculates accuracy as a performance metric.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluates the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error.
Model Tuning:

Uses GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.
Results Visualization:

Provides visualizations, including pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots, to offer insights into the relationships within the dataset.
Documentation and Reporting:

Encourages good coding practices with modular functions and documentation.
Guides users on dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
